  "intro": "Just like a lot of people, I started baking sourdough breads during the quarantine. Baking sourdough is not only fun (and frustrating) but also more healthy than a normal bread. The process of making a sourdough breaks down the enzymes so we can process it better and formats the carbs in a way that we can process them slowly. This is also known as slow carbs instead of quick carbs like in pasta and sugar."
